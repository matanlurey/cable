The `cable` package provides a re-usable interface for logging and defining
custom logging _destinations_, such as:

* in-memory
* terminals
* file I/O
* remote web services

... and more.

## Installation

Add `cable` as under `dependencies` in your [`pubspec.yaml`][pubspec] file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cable: ^0.1.0
```

And that's it! See [usage](#usage) for details.

## Usage

### Getting started

Out of the box `cable` provides two top-level methods, `log` and `logLazy`.

For simple string messages, use `log`:

```dart
void main() {
  log('Hello World!');
}
```

And for more complex messages that will need to be computed, use `logLazy`:

```dart
void main() {
  logLazy(() => 'The 100th digit of PI is ${computePiDigits(100)}');
}
```

Depending on the severity level, the closure for `logLazy` may not be invoked.

Both of these methods are intended to be for simpler use cases, with drawbacks:
* They just `print` string-like objects to console.
* The default severity is `Severity.debug` (all messages).
* They don't (immediately) support custom formatting, destinations, severity.

> **HINT**: Define a default `Severity` using Dart declaration variables.
>
> In the VM, set `CABLE_DEFAULT_SEVERITY` to `4`, or `Severity.warning`.
>
> ```bash
> $ dart bin/app.dart -dCABLE_DEFAULT_SEVERITY=4
> ```
>
> [Read more][declaration_variables] about Dart declaration variables.

### Creating a logger

A `Logger` class can be created and used for dependency injection:

```dart
void main() {
  final logger = new Logger();
  final service = new Service(logger: logger);
  // ...
}
```

You can also set the severity threshold:

```dart
void main() {
  final logger = new Logger(
    severity: Severity.warning,
  );
}
```

Or define a simple string formatter:

```dart
void main() {
  final logger = new Logger(
    // Writes string logs in the format of {name}: {message}.
    formatter: (record) => '${record.origin}: ${record.payload}',
  );
}
```

By default, a `Logger` just prints to the console. You can also configure one:

#### Custom destination(s)

> **NOTE**: This package intentionally is sparse on opinions or specific
> destinations in order to reduce your transitive dependencies to an absolute
> minimum. We encourage you to write and contribute to `cable_*` packages that
> provide interesting destinations/endpoints for `cable`!

```dart
void main() {
  final logger = new Logger(
   destinations: [
     // Any class that implements Sink<Record>
   ],
 );
}
```

Several built-in classes are available cross platform:

```dart
void main() {
  final logger = new Logger(
   destinations: [
     // Does nothing.
     LogSink.nullSink,
     
     // Prints to console.
     LogSink.printSink,
     
     // Use any Sink<String> instance, such as a `StreamController`.
     new LogSink.writeToSink(someEventController),
     
     // Use any StringSink instance, such as a `StringBuffer`.
     new LogSink.writeToBuffer(stringBuffer),
   ],
  );
}
```

It's also easy to create your own plugin packages!

```dart
class FileSink implements Sink<Record> {
  @override
  void add(Record data) { /* Write to a file. */ }

  @override
  void close() { /* Close the file stream. */ }
}

void main() {
  final logger = new Logger(
    destinations: [new FileSink(/*...*/)],
  );
}
```

### Override Functions

It's possible to replace `log` and `logLazy` to forward to your own configured
`Logger` instance at runtime - use `scope`:

```dart
void runLogged(Logger logger) {
  logger.scope(() => startApplication());
}
```

Using [zones][], any calls to `log` or `logLazy` inside of context of
`startApplication()` will now use your custom `logger` class, not the default
top-level function behavior.

## Contributing

We welcome a diverse set of contributions, including, but not limited to:

* [Filing bugs and feature requests][file_an_issue]
* [Send a pull request][pull_request]
* Or, create something awesome using this API and share with us and others!

For the stability of the API and existing users, consider opening an issue
first before implementing a large new feature or breaking an API. For smaller
changes (like documentation, minor bug fixes), just send a pull request.

### Testing

All pull requests are validated against [travis][travis], and must pass.

Ensure code passes all our [analyzer checks][analysis_options]:

```sh
$ dartanalyzer .
```

Ensure all code is formatted with the latest [dev-channel SDK][dev_sdk].

```sh
$ dartfmt -w .
```

Run all of our unit tests:

```sh
$ pub run test
```
